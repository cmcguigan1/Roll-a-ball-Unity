# Inspiration
Assignment 1 for my SE2250B Software Construction course, developed in Unity using C#

# How It Works
The goal of this project was to design a roll a ball game where the player would move around a ball on a game board, manouver obstacles and collect different objects for different points, depending on which object the user collects. In the design stage, we were required to write a one page document comparing two different options on how to approach certain tasks, their advantages and disadvantages.  

# Design Constraints
A few of the design constraints were: ensuring the ball realistically bounces off of the walls, dynamically adding the pickup objects to the game, restaring the game after a few seconds of the player winning, displaying the score and game over text to the player and adding different amounts of points for different pickup objects.
